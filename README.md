Mobile apps GUI testing: a systematic review 

The paper can be found at: [GUI testing for mobile applications: a systematic literature review](#)

This repo provide the list of the literature analyzed in the systematic review mentioned above and some other important data that may help the research community.


# Brief about the paper
The paper systematically reviews literature published between 2011 and 2020, to gain an insight into GUI testing for mobile apps. Specifically, the paper aims to identify (i) the main objective of GUI testing, (ii) the approaches/methods, as well as (iii) the performance evaluation criteria and metrics, and (iv) the challenges and future research direction. It follows a predefined systematic literature review procedure that involved both the automatic and manual search strategies to cover all relevant literature. The search of the literature was conducted over seven popular digital libraries. As a result, a total of 61 literature was found and analyzed using four research questions that aligned with the objectives of the paper.
